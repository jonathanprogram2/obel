## 🧠 Inspiration

Obel was inspired by the need for cleaner, more visual tools in the crypto space. It aims to empower users with insight—not just data—through AI-powered coin research, elegant UI, and futuristic branding built around the symbolism of obelisks and pyramids: permanence, power, and clarity.

---

## 📈 Future Plans

- Connect real crypto APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, Moralis, Lens Protocol)
- Add AI-driven recommendation engine
- Enable full Web3 wallet functionality (MetaMask, etc.)
- Create a social hub for users to discuss coins in real-time
- Expand Coin Intel page with real charting libraries and NLP sentiment feeds
