## 🧠 Inspiration

Obel was born from a desire to bring clarity, strategy, and design-forward thinking to long-term stock investing. Inspired by platforms like M1 Finance and Morningstar, it reimagines portfolio management through a more immersive and visually compelling experience. The name "Obel" draws from the symbolism of obelisks—representing strength, clarity, and permanence—mirroring the platform’s mission to help investors build lasting wealth with confidence and insight.
